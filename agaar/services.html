							<h4>Mini-Grid Systems</h4>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/servicepgpic2.png" alt="" /></span>A small-scale power network fueled by solar energy is known as a mini-grid. The clients linked to this mini-grid power network get the generated electricity either directly or indirectly through batteries. It is simple to link a group of people that live close to one another, such as in a hamlet, to the grid. In Kenya's underserved rural areas, where sunlight is available for most of the year, solar mini-grids are the most flexible and practical method for supplying electricity. First off, Kenya's policy landscape is becoming more pro-renewable energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology's cost and accessibility have both continuously improved over the past ten years, and unlike just a few years ago, solar power systems are now modular and expandable based on the needs of the customers. A solar mini-grid has the benefit of being able to handle increased energy demands, such as those of Kenyan enterprises. Kenya's rural areas benefit from a solar mini-grid, but it can only be economically implemented if clients are close enough to one another.</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/visionpic1.png" alt="" /></span>You might operate from a single location or be part of a worldwide corporation, you might work for the government or the private sector, and you might be located in Turkana or the center of Nairobi. We will work with you to identify your optimal renewable energy solution, regardless of whether your goal is to lower your carbon footprint, lower energy expenses, or provide a consistent energy supply.</p>
